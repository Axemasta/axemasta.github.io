This repository contains my personal website / blog. It is built from a Jeykyll template called [Clean Blog Jekyll](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/clean-blog-jekyll).

I will be posting technical blog posts to this site, the topics will usually be related to challenges i've faced during my day to day as a mobile / cloud focussed .NET developer. If you have any suggestions for blog posts I'd be happy to entertain your suggestions! ðŸ˜Š

## Build

To build this website perform the following steps:

 - Clone this repository
 - Open with Visual Studio Code
 - Open a terminal window
 - Enter the command: `jekyll server --livereload`

The site will now build and available to browse locally on port 4000: `http://127.0.0.1:4000/`
